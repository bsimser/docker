## docker

This is a repo I setup to hold various Dockerfiles I use. It was inspired by [Jessie Frazelle's](https://github.com/jessfraz) [own repository](https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles).

Each Dockerfile lives in its own folder named after the application/tool it runs. You should (technically) be able to run any of these as-is, although some might require API keys or OAuth tokens and such so YMMV.

All Dockerfiles should have comments at the top with instructions for running it but feel free to send me a pull request if there isn't one (or the one there isn't clear or valid).
